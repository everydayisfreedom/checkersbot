- The white pieces are the ones that the bot is playing (the moves are delayed by 100ms), while the pink pieces are the playerâ€™s ones (undelayed). 
- The first move is always left to the player.
- Possible moves are marked in pink.
- King piece is marked in yellow.
- All the considered moves are printed in the console.
